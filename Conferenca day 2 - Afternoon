DESIGNING CHOICE - Adrian Zumbrunnen
	- good design is about making choices 
	- not choising or le the user decide is an abdication of the design's responsability
	Number od options: 
		decision is difficolt beacause there 's alway the wonder of what is letting go 
		better have less choices
		too many options can literally stop us to make a decision
		- the flaw of mvp --> we dspand lot of time redisigning the product

	Placebo choices:
		- the illusion of control change the way you feel about choising
		es: bread maker (nuobvo prodotto piÃ¹ caro solo per far comprare il primo che allo stesso prezzo non era stato comprato da molti)
		
		Deliberally adding an option can make peolple more effective in decision

	Moments matter:
		the right moment can cahange how the pople feel in decision

	Friction:
		- frictionless take off all the critical thinking 
		- so friction can improve UX
		es: blogger loading icon
		the timing is important (so fster is not always better)
		UX bear --> conversation about UX

	Default behaviors:
		'Dont make me think' mentality
		Dafault can be frustating
		Default can make or break an experience
